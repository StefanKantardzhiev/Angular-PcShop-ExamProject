Registering and logging users with quick links in the forms of login and register,as well as a guard checking if the user is Logged or not.

Registered and new users will be able to see the home,but only the new ones will be able to see the latest builds.
When the user registers or login , he will be able to see all of the offers, as well as edit and delete buttons if owner.


Every user can upload their own photos, add title, description, price and attach a link for their photos. When creating/deleting a pc build.At every stage of the creation and/or editing the user will be reminded by errors if the forms are not correctly filled.If everything is OK, users will be able to access and edit/delete all of the content related to them.
